# Lab03-JS
This is a project I originally completed in C# for school around 2016, now converted to JavaScript using P5.js.

This project was used to demonstrate some OOP conecpts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and the use of multithreading (currently missing in the JS version).

[Here is the original C# version with a video to demonstrate it](https://github.com/jstelte/Lab03CSharp)

[Here is the JS version running on the P5.js webeditor](https://editor.p5js.org/jstelte/sketches/PauKOTffG)
