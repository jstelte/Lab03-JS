# Lab03-JS
This is a project I originally completed in C# for school around 2016, now converted to JavaScript using P5.js.

I haven't converted everything over as the original C# program was multithreaded, but that is the next step.

This project was used to demonstrate some OOP conecpts, such as inheritance and polymorphism, and the use of multithreading (currently missing in the JS version).
